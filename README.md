# MERN-Projects

### Important Note:
I initially tried consolidating all my projects into a single repository for convenience. However, it became chaotic and challenging to manage.

### New Approach:
Moving forward, each project will have its own separate repository on GitHub. This change aims to maintain clarity and organization.

### Repository Status:
This repository will no longer be actively maintained. It will solely contain my first two MERN stack projects. Subsequent projects will have their dedicated repositories.

### Purpose:
This repository houses my initial two projects developed in the MERN stack.

### Navigation Guide:
- Explore individual folders to access project-specific README files for detailed insights.
